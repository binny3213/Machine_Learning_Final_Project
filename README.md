# Machine_Learning_Final_Project
As part of our final project me and my partners had to perform a machine learning model for a wine classification problem. 
We basically got files of lots of different wine shows and had to model them according to the 3 different categories.
We had a learning set, and a test set on which we performed and evaluated the quality of the model. 
Really nice project and we learned a lot from it.
